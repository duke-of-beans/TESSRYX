## Current Blockers

### 🚧 Blockers:
**NONE** - Foundation complete

### ⚠️ Risks:
1. **Scope creep risk:** TessIR spec could become too complex
   - Mitigation: Start minimal (20-30 constraint types), expand based on evidence
   
2. **Perfection paralysis:** Could spend months on spec
   - Mitigation: Time-box Phase 0 to 4 weeks max, iterate based on feedback
   
3. **Technology choice lock-in:** Python → Rust migration path unclear
   - Mitigation: Design TessIR to be implementation-agnostic, create clear interfaces

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Strategic Wedge:** Software Development (not Automotive)
   - Rationale: Data immediately available, fast validation, technical buyers
   - Decision Date: 2026-01-19
   - Decided By: Post-Genius Council synthesis

2. **Technology Stack V1:** Python + NetworkX + OR-Tools + Postgres
   - Rationale: Fast iteration, mature ecosystems, AI-assisted development friendly
   - Decision Date: 2026-01-19
   - Decided By: Genius Council consensus

3. **Open TessIR Specification:** Publish as open standard
   - Rationale: Establishes TESSRYX as "the standard," enables ecosystem
   - Decision Date: 2026-01-19
   - Decided By: Genius Council recommendation (GPT explicit)

4. **Database Strategy:** Postgres first, migrate to hybrid if needed
   - Rationale: Defer expensive decision until evidence available
   - Decision Date: 2026-01-19
   - Decided By: Claude synthesis (resolving GPT vs Gemini disagreement)

5. **Constraint Design:** First-class objects (not edge properties)
   - Rationale: Enables versioning, reuse, conflict detection
   - Decision Date: 2026-01-19
   - Decided By: Genius Council consensus (unanimous)

6. **Instruction System:** Hierarchical two-tier (in-app routing + local detailed)
   - Rationale: Token efficiency, scalability, proven DEV pattern
   - Decision Date: 2026-01-19
   - Decided By: David + Claude collaboration
