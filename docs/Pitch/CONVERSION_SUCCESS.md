Subject: TESSRYX - Dependency Intelligence Infrastructure ($2-5M Seed)

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out to share TESSRYX, a Universal Dependency Intelligence 
Infrastructure that uses formal verification to transform dependency 
management from reactive firefighting to proactive certainty.

Key points:
- $20B+ DevSecOps market (validated by Snyk $3.3B, Datadog $42B)
- Formal verification provides mathematical proof upgrade plans work
- 18-24 month technical moat before competitors can respond
- Raising $2-5M seed for 18-month runway to $1M ARR

Attached is a 2-page executive summary. Would you be open to a 
30-minute conversation?

Best,
David Wasniatka
Founder & CEO, TESSRYX
