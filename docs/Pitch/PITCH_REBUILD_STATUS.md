## PRESENTATION TIPS

### Opening the Deck

2. Open `TESSRYX_Pitch_Deck_FIXED.html` in browser
3. Press F11 for fullscreen
4. Use arrow keys to navigate

### Key Messages
1. **Problem:** 90% of code is third-party, 80% never upgraded (Sonatype data)
2. **Solution:** Formal verification provides proof, not guesses
3. **Market:** $20B+ DevSecOps (validated by $3.3B Snyk, $42B+ Datadog)
4. **Moat:** 18-24 mo engineering lead, constraint taxonomy, ecosystem lock-in
5. **Ask:** $2-5M for 18-month runway to $1M ARR

### Handling Questions
- **"Where did you get this data?"** → Slide 14 (Appendix) has all sources
- **"Why will this work?"** → Cognitive monopoly through superior math (formal verification)
- **"What about Snyk?"** → They're struggling (down from $8.5B to $3.3B), heuristic approach
- **"Market size?"** → Conservative estimates, can show bottom-up calc

- **Professional:** 7/10 (nice design, bad data)
- **Investor-Ready:** 2/10 (would damage relationships)

### After Rebuild
- **Credibility:** 9/10 (all data verified or properly labeled)
- **Professional:** 9/10 (clean, interactive, comprehensive)
- **Investor-Ready:** 9/10 (honest, defensible, compelling)
