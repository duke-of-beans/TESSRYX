## CLAIMS TO REMOVE (Unverifiable/Fabricated)

### RED FLAGS - REMOVE IMMEDIATELY
1. ❌ **"$500B+ annual failure cost"** (Slide 14)
   - NO SOURCE FOUND in any free research
   - Likely fabricated or misattributed
   - **ACTION:** REMOVE completely

2. ❌ **Exit valuations** (Slide 16)
   - "$3-5B strategic acquisition"
   - "$5-10B+ IPO path"  
   - "$10B+ platform dominance"
   - **ACTION:** Remove dollar amounts, replace with qualitative statements

3. ❌ **Industry Vertical Markets** (Slides 5-6)
   - "$80B ERP/PLM/MES"
   - "$24-32B ServiceNow CMDB" (ServiceNow total revenue ~$8B!)
   - "$50B+ Federal IT"
   - "$15-30B Automotive"
   - "$6-10B Construction"
   - **ISSUE:** These are TOTAL industry IT spend, not addressable for dependency intelligence
   - **ACTION:** Recalculate or remove, replace with honest estimates

---

## CLAIMS TO FIX (Update with Sources)

### YELLOW FLAGS - UPDATE WITH CAVEATS
1. **TAM/SAM/SOM** ($26.8B / $8B / $500M)
   - No methodology shown
   - **ACTION:** Build bottom-up estimate OR label as "Company estimate"

2. **Business Metrics**
   - 7% free-to-paid conversion (industry avg: 2-5%)
   - 130% NRR (very high)
   - 3% monthly dev churn (36%/year - seems high)
   - **ACTION:** Add caveats "Projected based on industry benchmarks"

3. **Technical Moat Timelines**
   - "18-24 months to replicate"
   - **ACTION:** Change to "We estimate 18-24 months based on engineering complexity"

---

## REBUILD STRATEGY

### Phase 1 (THIS SESSION) - Priority Documents
1. **Pitch Deck HTML** - Most critical, rebuild with:
   - Remove all red flags
   - Update competitor valuations with sources
   - Replace market sizes with honest estimates
   - Add Sonatype data for credibility
   - Remove exit value speculation

### Phase 2 (NEXT SESSION IF NEEDED) - Word Documents
1. Executive Summary.docx
2. Master Pitch Document.docx
3. Technical Brief.docx

**Note:** Word docs need conversion from binary to markdown for editing

---

## REPLACEMENT CONTENT (Honest Estimates)

### Market Sizing Approach
Instead of unverified numbers, use:
- "Based on industry research and analysis..."
- "Conservative estimates suggest..."
- "Comparable to the $XB DevSecOps market (Source: Industry reports)"

### Competition Section
Replace with:
- "As of January 2026, Snyk valued at $3.3B (down from $8.5B peak)"
- "Datadog trading at $42B+ market cap"
- "Snowflake at $72B+ demonstrates appetite for dev infrastructure"

### Industry Impact
Replace "$500B" with:
- "Supply chain vulnerabilities represent massive cost burden"
- "Sonatype reports 704K malicious packages in 2024 alone"
- "156% year-over-year increase in supply chain attacks"

### Exit Potential
Replace speculation with:
- "Strategic acquisition opportunity (comparable companies: Snyk, GitHub)"
- "IPO path similar to Datadog, Snowflake at scale"
- "Platform economics create defensible moat"

## VERIFIED TALKING POINTS (Use These)

### Problem Validation
✅ "6.6 trillion open source downloads annually" (Sonatype 2024)
✅ "90% of modern applications are third-party components" (Sonatype)
✅ "80% of dependencies remain unupgraded for over a year" (Sonatype)
✅ "Supply chain attacks increased 156% year-over-year" (Sonatype 2024)

### Competitive Landscape
✅ "Snyk recently valued at $3.3B (Jan 2026)" (Tracxn)
✅ "Datadog trades at $42B+ market cap" (Yahoo Finance)
✅ "Developer security tools seeing significant investment"

### Opportunity Framing
✅ "Existing tools focus on detection, not prevention"
✅ "No formal verification layer exists in dependency management"
✅ "Constraint solving approach creates technical differentiation"

## NEXT STEPS FOR SESSION 2 (IF NEEDED)

### Research Tasks
1. **Market Sizing:**
   - Calculate bottom-up TAM: (# developers) × (% using dep mgmt) × (avg spend/seat)
   - Find Gartner/Forrester free reports or executive summaries
   - Use Stack Overflow Survey for developer counts

2. **Competitor Deep Dive:**
   - Verify Sonatype $4.5B valuation
   - Research Dependabot (GitHub), Renovate capabilities
   - Build competitive feature matrix

3. **Financial Model:**
   - Create Excel with revenue assumptions
   - Calculate realistic free-to-paid conversion (3-5%)
   - Model enterprise contract ASPs ($50K-500K)

### Documents to Create
1. Sources & Methodology Appendix
2. Financial Model (Excel)
3. Competitive Analysis Summary
4. Q&A Document (investor questions)
